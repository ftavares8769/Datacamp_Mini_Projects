# DataCamp Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of small, self-contained projects completed as part of various DataCamp courses. Each project focuses on applying core data analysis skills using Python, pandas, and visualization libraries.  

The mini-projects here are grouped together in this single repository, while my larger independent projects are organized in their own dedicated repositories.  

## Contents

- **Sleep Health** â€” exploring the relationship between lifestyle factors and sleep disorders  
- **Schools** â€” analyzing school bus and district data

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
